I‚Äôm **Sidra Anwar**, a QA Tester and Android Developer with over 3 years of hands-on experience in building, testing, and optimizing mobile applications. I specialize in delivering high-quality digital products through a combined skill set in both mobile development and quality assurance.

With a strong foundation in Android development, I understand the intricacies of mobile app performance, UI/UX behavior, and real-world device challenges. My QA experience includes manual and automated testing, API testing, regression analysis, and usability assessments ‚Äî enabling me to find critical bugs before users do.

I focus on ensuring application stability, performance, and user satisfaction by combining development insights with rigorous testing methodologies. This dual expertise allows me to bridge the gap between development and testing teams, driving collaboration and improving software quality across the board.

Graduated from [International Islamic University Islamabad](https://www.iiu.edu.pk/) as a Software Engineers, I bring a well-rounded and analytical mindset to every project I work on. I enjoy solving complex problems, enhancing product quality, and working with teams that value detail, performance, and innovation.
